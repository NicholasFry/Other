# Write a program that takes in a suggested password from a user.  The program should
# require the password string to contain:

# 	At least one lowercase letter [a-z]
# 	At least one digit [0-9]
# 	At least one uppercase letter [A-Z]
# 	At least one symbol from [$#@]
# The password string must be anywhere from 6 to 12 characters, inclusive.
# The program should take in the string, perform the determination, and print out
# either 'accepted' or 'rejected', and if rejected state why (which rule was violated).
